# Contributor Code of Conduct
This Code of Conduct is based on [Angular's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/angular/code-of-conduct/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

As contributors and maintainers of the IssueTracker Demo project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of our channels (GitHub, Gitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the IssueTracker Demo project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the IssueTracker Demo project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please use [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ehaberev) to send message to us.
